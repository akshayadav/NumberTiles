The game starts with 4X3 matrix of tiles, with numbers 1 to 12, in random order.
The tiles keep changing background color, and the numbers periodically.
Player has to keep the count in head and tap the numbers in order. On successfully tapping a number, that number will be replaced by the next number in sequence.
